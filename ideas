- add steam generator

- add steam pump

- use 'world pipes'
	- this means use cavity pipes rather than itemised pipes
	- does not require item
	- pump required to move steam after set distance (1 - 3 chunks?) of 'world pipe'
	- use negative pressure fluids?

- add basic 'machines'
	- furnace powered by steam (makes no sense, but then again not many mods do)
	- some form of macerator powered on steam... maybe gear assembly required?

- automatons?
	- need to research modelling & ai
		- have book on ai
		- use VSWE's course for info on modelling for mc

- brass goggles
	- provide info on automatons and machines
		- automaton level of intelligence?
		- machine steam levels, maybe pressure too?
